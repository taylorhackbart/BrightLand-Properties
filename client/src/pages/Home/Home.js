  Hello, I am petitioning to change our current day light savings times. In the United States, we adopted day light savings as a way to manipulate the times of sunset and sunrise. Daylight hours during winter are shorter than in the summer by approximately 3 hours. Our current average time for sunset in summer is 8pm, and 445pm in winter. 

  Our goal with this petition is to alter these by reverting back to standard hours during summer, and gaining an hour during winter to push sunset back to 545pm.
